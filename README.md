Peer Assessment 1 - run_analysis.R
This repository contains the analysis that is used on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone datasets that in turn creates the tidy dataset.

The R Script does the following:
Download and clean up the data
Label the columns as necessary.
Merge test and train datasets into one big dataset.
Create a tidy dataset that includes the average of each variable and each subject.
There will be two text files in the end: data_set.txt and tidy_data.txt
